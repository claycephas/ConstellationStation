
CONSTELLATION STATION - YOU Make the Night Sky!
------------------------------------------------

PHASES
1	Bugs, Code organization, cleanup, saving
2	Options, UI, terrain cleaning
3	Graphics optimization, selecting, random starfield
4	Pretty graphics, text
5	Features (tests, actual)


BUGS
-	2	Roundoff error with sliders
	3	Random starfield is blank
	3	select line isn't checking for terrain hits
	5	Program Icon  (WM_SETICON)

GENERAL
-	1	Read-through cleaning
		- terrain
-	1	Sanity checks
-	2	Splash Screen
-	2	Need star colors again
	3	Spin sun separately
	5	Undo
	5	Print

OPTIONS
-	2	sun options
-	2	compass options
-	2	colors (terrain seasons)
-	2	Load on startup
	3	number of stars
	3	textured stars
	3	brighness / gamma
	4	constellation labels
	4	star names
	5	home location

INPUT MGR
-	2	Double click to select constellation
-	2	Keep Mouse in place while rotating

GRAPHICS MGR
	3	Draw mouse-overed line different color
	3	Improve 3D math.
	3	Implement brightness and contrast
	3	Make small stars points, not quads
	3	Hide dim stars when zoomed out
	3	Show dim stars when zoomed in
	3	Bright are too bright. Dim are too dim
	3	Lighting is shining through
	3?	Lower texture quality
	4	Print Constellation Name near constellation
	4	Heading indicator needs work.
		- Do it like Starry Night?
	5	Celestial Grid

CONSTELLATION MGR
	5	Input actual constellations
	5	Constellation details

STARFIELD MGR
-	2	New actual without constellations?
-	2	Don't ask for save so much with actual
	3	Implement limiting magnitude
	3?	Prompt for seed with random stars
	5	Choose date
	5	Choose time
	5	Choose location (lat & long)
	5	Increase year range
	5	Link time with starfield
	5	Inc/Dec by 1/2/3 years/days/hours/mins
	5	Add Stars?
	5	Precession?

TERRAIN MGR
-	2	Same seed for all roughnesses until generate new
-	2?	vectors
	4	Textured terrain

TEACHER MGR
CONSTELLATION TESTS
	5	TYPES
		- Show constlines. Pick a line
		- Don't show constlines. Pick a star 
		- Draw constellation
	5	Choose constellations in test
