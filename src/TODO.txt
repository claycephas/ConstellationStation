
CONSTELLATION STATION - YOU Make the Night Sky!
------------------------------------------------

PHASES
1	Cleanup - Bugs, organization, saving
2	Options - UI, dialogs
3	Math - graphics optimization, terrain, selecting, random
4	Graphics - effects, text
5	Features - tests, actual


BUGS
-	3	Terrain isn't depth testing
-	3	cursor doesn't hide after open
-	3	Random starfield is blank
	5	Program Icon
		- frame.GetIcon()
		- frame.SetIcon()
		- create structure
		- (WM_SETICON)

GENERAL
-	1	PORTALES: 34.6 North
-	1	Read-through cleaning / Sanity checks
		- DataTerrain
-	3	Spin sun separately
-	3	Improve zooming (dependent on zoom)
	5	Don't maximize on startup
	5	Redraw starfield toolbar buttons
	5	Splash Screen
	5	Print
	5	Undo

OPTIONS
-	3	textured stars
-	3?	Rotate / Zoom speed
	4	Terrain shadows on/off
	4	constellation labels
	4	star names
	5	home location

INPUT MGR
-	3	Trackball
-	3	Keep Mouse in place while rotating

GRAPHICS MGR
-	3	Find constellation
-	3	Draw mouse-overed line different color
-	3	Improve 3D math.
-	3	Make small stars points, not quads
-	3	Hide dim stars when zoomed out
-	3	Show dim stars when zoomed in
-	3	Lighting is shining through
-	3?	Lower star texture quality
	4	Print Constellation Name near constellation
		- moveable?
	4	Heading indicator needs work.
		- Do it like Starry Night?
	5	Celestial Grid

CONSTELLATION MGR
	5	Input actual constellations
	5	Constellation details

STARFIELD MGR
-	3?	Prompt for seed with random stars
	5	Choose date
	5	Choose time
	5	Choose location (lat & long)
	5	Increase year range
	5	Link time with starfield
	5	Inc/Dec by 1/2/3 years/days/hours/mins
	5?	Add Stars
	5?	Precession

TERRAIN MGR
-	3	change spaces to tabs
-	3	viewheight is choppy
-	3	Generate first few so you're sitting in a valley
-	3?	More circular
-	3?	vectors
-	3	Iterations / scale
	4	Textured terrain

DOCUMENT MGR
-	3	Save just seed. Actual = -1
	5	Import/Export constellations (must check seed if random starf)

TEACHER MGR
	5	CONSTELLATION TESTS
		- Types
			- Show constlines. Pick a line
			- Don't show constlines. Pick a star 
			- Draw constellation
		- Choose constellations in test
